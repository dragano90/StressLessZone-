Anyone can practice meditation. It's simple and inexpensive, and it doesn't require any special equipment.

                        <p>Meditation has been practiced for thousands of years, originally meant to help deepen understanding of the sacred and mystical forces of life. These days, meditation is commonly used for relaxation and stress reduction. Meditation is considered a type of mind-body complementary medicine.
                        
                        Meditation produces a deep state of relaxation and a tranquil mind. During meditation, you focus your attention and eliminate the stream of jumbled thoughts that may be crowding your mind and causing stress. This process results in enhanced physical and emotional well-being.</p>

And these benefits don't end when your meditation session ends. Meditation can help carry you more calmly through your day and can even improve certain medical conditions.</p>

                        <p>When you meditate, you clear away the information overload that builds up every day and contributes to your stress. The emotional benefits of meditation include:</p>

While a growing body of scientific research supports the health benefits of meditation, some researchers believe it's not yet possible to draw conclusions about the possible benefits of meditation. With that in mind, some research suggests that meditation may help such conditions as:</P>

                        <P> Be sure to talk to your health care provider about the pros and cons of using meditation if you have any of these conditions or other health problems. In some cases, meditation can worsen symptoms associated with certain mental health conditions. Meditation isn't a replacement for traditional medical treatment.

                            </li>
                            <li>
                        
                        <h3>Breathe Deeply:</h3>
                        <uL>
                         <li>This technique is good for beginners because breathing is a natural function. Focus all 
                            attention on your breathing. Concentrate on feeling and listening as you inhale and exhale through your 
                            nostrils. Breathe deeply and slowly. When your attention wanders, gently return your focus to your 
                            breathing</li>
                    </uL>
    
                        <h3>Scan Your Body: </h3>
                        <ul>
                       <li> When using this technique, focus attention on different parts of your body. Become aware 
                        of your body's various sensations, whether that's pain, tension, warmth or relaxation. Combine body 
                        scanning with breathing exercises and imagine breathing heat or relaxation into and out of different parts of 
                        your body</li>
                    </ul>
    
                         <h3>Repeat a Mantra: </h3>
                         <ul>
                        <li>You can create your own mantra, whether it's religious or secular. Examples of religious 
                            mantras include the Jesus Prayer in the Christian tradition, the holy name of God in Judaism, or the om 
                            mantra of Hinduism, Buddhism and other Eastern religions</li>
                    </ul>
    
                         <h3>Walk and Meditate: <h3>
                        <ul>
                         <li>Combining a walk with meditation is an efficient and healthy way to relax. You can use 
                            this technique anywhere you're walking — in a tranquil forest, on a city sidewalk or at the mall. When you 
                            use this method, slow down the pace of walking so that you can focus on each movement of your legs or 
                            feet. Don't focus on a particular destination. Concentrate on your legs and feet, repeating action words in 
                            your mind such as lifting, moving and placing as you lift each foot, move your leg forward and place your 
                            foot on the ground</li>
                    </ul>
    
                        <h3>Engage in Prayer: <h3>
                            <ul>
                        <li>Prayer is the best known and most widely practiced example of meditation. Spoken and 
                            written prayers are found in most faith traditions. You can pray using your own words or read prayers 
                            written by others. Check the self-help or 12-step-recovery section of your local bookstore for examples. Talk 
                            with your rabbi, priest, pastor or other spiritual leader about resources</li>
                    </ul>
    
                        <h3>Read and Reflect: <h3>
                            <ul>
                        <li>Many people report that they benefit from reading poems or sacred texts, and taking a
                            few moments to quietly reflect on their meaning. You also can listen to sacred music, spoken words or any 
                            music you find relaxing or inspiring. You may want to write your reflections in a journal or discuss them with 
                            a friend or spiritual leader</li>
                    </ul>
    
                        <h3>Focus Your Love and Gratitude:<h3>
                            <ul>
                        <li>In this type of meditation, you focus your attention on a sacred object or 
                            being, weaving feelings of love and gratitude into your thoughts. You can also close your eyes and use your 
                            imagination or gaze at representations of the object.</li>
                    </ul>
    
                        <strong class="subtopic">Building Your Meditation Skills</strong>
                           <p>Don't judge your meditation skills, which may only increase your stress. Meditation takes practice. Keep in mind, 
                            for instance, that it's common for your mind to wander during meditation, no matter how long you've been 
                            practicing meditation. If you're meditating to calm your mind and your attention wanders, slowly return to the 
                            object, sensation or movement you're focusing on. 
                            Experiment, and you'll likely find out what types of meditation work best for you and what you enjoy doing. 
                            Adapt meditation to your needs at the moment. Remember, there's no right way or wrong way to meditate. 
                            What matters is that meditation helps you with stress reduction and feeling better overall.</p>

                        <h2>EATING FOR STRESS</h2>
                    
                        <p>Even in the best of times, you need food to survive and be healthy. Chronic stress (or stress overdrive) is certainly not the best of times, so the food choices you make become even more important to your health.</p>
                    
                        <p>Some diets, like ketogenic and paleo, are great in some instances but are not best for those experiencing chronic stress or stress overdrive. Here are some tips for eating for stress:</p>
                    
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong class="subtopic">GOLDEN RATIO</strong>
                                <p>In each meal and snack include: protein (more vegetarian than animal); complex carbohydrates (whole grains), starchy vegetables (like carrots, sweet potatoes and legumes), and good quality fats (fresh olive, coconut, sesame, or flax oil)</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong class="subtopic">EAT YOUR VEGETABLES</strong>
                                <p>Every day, you should include 6-8 servings of a wide variety of vegetables in your meals, especially those that are naturally highly colored (bright green, red, orange, yellow, or purple). Vegetables provide essential vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and a high amount of fiber.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong class="subtopic">AT REGULAR INTERVALS</strong>
                                <p>Long periods without food and nourishment make your adrenals work harder, which means more cortisol released to help the body function. Having 3 nutritious meals, plus 2-3 snacks spread throughout the day, is a great way to help balance blood sugar and decrease the workload on your adrenals.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong class="subtopic">CAFFEINE</strong>
                                <p>Like what you eat, what you choose to drink will either support or put a strain on your adrenals. People with chronic stress should avoid caffeinated drinks like coffee, tea, soda, and energy drinks. The caffeine may provide a temporary boost, but it will leave you feeling worse soon after.</p>

                                <p>Good quality protein from meat, fish, fowl, eggs, dairy and especially various plant sources (soy and other legumes, nuts and seeds) is essential for stress. Try to avoid processed proteins, such as packaged lunch meats and processed cheeses.</p>
                            </li>

                                <strong class="subtopic">SUGAR AND WHITE FLOUR</strong>
                                <p>Ironically, foods made with these ingredients such as doughnuts, rolls, pies, cakes, cookies, crackers, and candy bars are the ones that many people suffering from chronic stress crave. Sugar and white flour are entirely naked calories, the metabolism of which drains an already depleted body of the vitamins and minerals it needs to heal or to maintain.</p>

                    <h2>Meditation: A Simple, Fast Way to Reduce Stress</h2> 

                   <p>If stress has you anxious, tense, and worried, consider trying meditation. Spending even a few minutes in meditation can restore your calm and inner peace. Anyone can practice meditation. It's simple and inexpensive, and it doesn't require any special equipment. And you can practice meditation wherever you are — whether you're out for a walk, riding the bus, waiting at the doctor's office, or even in the middle of a difficult business meeting.</p>

                    <p>Meditation has been practiced for thousands of years, originally meant to help deepen understanding of the sacred and mystical forces of life. These days, meditation is commonly used for relaxation and stress reduction. Meditation is considered a type of mind-body complementary medicine.
                    
                    Meditation produces a deep state of relaxation and a tranquil mind. During meditation, you focus your attention and eliminate the stream of jumbled thoughts that may be crowding your mind and causing stress. This process results in enhanced physical and emotional well-being.</p>

And these benefits don't end when your meditation session ends. Meditation can help carry you more calmly through your day and can even improve certain medical conditions.</p>

                    <P>Meditation might be useful if you have a medical condition, especially one that may be worsened by stress. While a growing body of scientific research supports the health benefits of meditation, some researchers believe it's not yet possible to draw conclusions about the possible benefits of meditation. With that in mind, some research suggests that meditation may help such conditions as:</P>
                    
                    <P>- Allergies</P>
                    <P>- Anxiety disorders</P>

                    <P> Be sure to talk to your health care provider about the pros and cons of using meditation if you have any of these conditions or other health problems. In some cases, meditation can worsen symptoms associated with certain mental health conditions. Meditation isn't a replacement for traditional medical treatment. But it may be a useful addition to your other treatment.<P></P>

                    <p>Different types of meditation may include different features to help you meditate. These may vary depending on whose guidance you follow or who's teaching a class. Some of the most common features in meditation include:</p>

                    <strong class="subtopic">Everyday Ways to Practice Meditation</strong>
                    
                    <p>Don't let the thought of meditating the "right" way add to your stress. Sure, you can attend special meditation 
                        centers or group classes led by trained instructors. But you also can practice meditation easily on your own. 
                        And you can make meditation as formal or informal as you like — whatever suits your lifestyle and situation. 
                        Some people build meditation into their daily routine. For example, they may start and end each day with an 
                        hour of meditation. But all you really need is a few minutes of quality time for meditation. 
                        Here are some ways you can practice meditation on your own, whenever you choose</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                    
                    <h3>Breathe Deeply:</h3>
                    <uL>
                     <li>This technique is good for beginners because breathing is a natural function. Focus all 
                        attention on your breathing. Concentrate on feeling and listening as you inhale and exhale through your 
                        nostrils. Breathe deeply and slowly. When your attention wanders, gently return your focus to your 
                        breathing</li>
                </uL>

                    <h3>Scan Your Body: </h3>
                    <ul>
                   <li> When using this technique, focus attention on different parts of your body. Become aware 
                    of your body's various sensations, whether that's pain, tension, warmth or relaxation. Combine body 
                    scanning with breathing exercises and imagine breathing heat or relaxation into and out of different parts of 
                    your body</li>
                </ul>

                     <h3>Repeat a Mantra: </h3>
                     <ul>
                    <li>You can create your own mantra, whether it's religious or secular. Examples of religious 
                        mantras include the Jesus Prayer in the Christian tradition, the holy name of God in Judaism, or the om 
                        mantra of Hinduism, Buddhism and other Eastern religions</li>
                </ul>

                     <h3>Walk and Meditate: <h3>
                    <ul>
                     <li>Combining a walk with meditation is an efficient and healthy way to relax. You can use 
                        this technique anywhere you're walking — in a tranquil forest, on a city sidewalk or at the mall. When you 
                        use this method, slow down the pace of walking so that you can focus on each movement of your legs or 
                        feet. Don't focus on a particular destination. Concentrate on your legs and feet, repeating action words in 
                        your mind such as lifting, moving and placing as you lift each foot, move your leg forward and place your 
                        foot on the ground</li>
                </ul>

                    <h3>Engage in Prayer: <h3>
                        <ul>
                    <li>Prayer is the best known and most widely practiced example of meditation. Spoken and 
                        written prayers are found in most faith traditions. You can pray using your own words or read prayers 
                        written by others. Check the self-help or 12-step-recovery section of your local bookstore for examples. Talk 
                        with your rabbi, priest, pastor or other spiritual leader about resources</li>
                </ul>

                    <h3>Read and Reflect: <h3>
                        <ul>
                    <li>Many people report that they benefit from reading poems or sacred texts, and taking a
                        few moments to quietly reflect on their meaning. You also can listen to sacred music, spoken words or any 
                        music you find relaxing or inspiring. You may want to write your reflections in a journal or discuss them with 
                        a friend or spiritual leader</li>
                </ul>

                    <h3>Focus Your Love and Gratitude:<h3>
                        <ul>
                    <li>In this type of meditation, you focus your attention on a sacred object or 
                        being, weaving feelings of love and gratitude into your thoughts. You can also close your eyes and use your 
                        imagination or gaze at representations of the object.</li>
                </ul>

                    <strong class="subtopic">Building Your Meditation Skills</strong>
                       <p>Don't judge your meditation skills, which may only increase your stress. Meditation takes practice. Keep in mind, 
                        for instance, that it's common for your mind to wander during meditation, no matter how long you've been 
                        practicing meditation. If you're meditating to calm your mind and your attention wanders, slowly return to the 
                        object, sensation or movement you're focusing on. 
                        Experiment, and you'll likely find out what types of meditation work best for you and what you enjoy doing. 
                        Adapt meditation to your needs at the moment. Remember, there's no right way or wrong way to meditate. 
                        What matters is that meditation helps you with stress reduction and feeling better overall.</p>

                <h2>EATING FOR STRESS</h2>

<p>Even in the best of times, you need food to survive and be healthy. Chronic stress (or stress overdrive) are certainly not the best of times, so the food choices you make become even more important to your health.</p>

<p>Some diets, like ketogenic and paleo, are great in some instances but are not best for those experiencing chronic stress or stress overdrive. Here are some tips to eating for stress:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
<strong class="subtopic">GOLDEN RATIO</strong> 

<p>In each meal and snack include: protein (more vegetarian than animal); complex carbohydrates (whole grains), starchy vegetables (like carrots, sweet potatoes and legumes), and good quality fats (fresh olive, coconut, sesame, or flax oil)</p>

</li>
<li>

    <strong class="subtopic">EAT YOUR VEGETABLES</strong> 

<p>Every day, you should include 6-8 servings of a wide variety of vegetables in your meals, especially those that are naturally highly colored (bright green, red, orange, yellow or purple). Vegetables provide essential vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and a high amount of fiber.</p>
<li>
</li>


<strong class="subtopic" >AT REGULAR INTERVALS</strong>

<p>Long periods without food and nourishment make your adrenals work harder, which means more cortisol released to help the body function. Having 3 nutritious meals, plus 2-3 snacks spread throughout the day, is a great way to help balance blood sugar and decrease the workload on your adrenals.</p>
<li>
</li>

<strong class="subtopic">CAFFEINE</strong> 

<p>Like what you eat, what you choose to drink will either support or put a strain on your adrenals. People with chronic stress should avoid caffeinated drinks like coffee, tea, soda, and energy drinks. The caffeine may provide a temporary boost, but it will leave you feeling worse soon after.</p>

<li>
</li>

<strong class="subtopic">DON'T FORGET THE PROTEIN</strong>

<p>Good quality protein from meat, fish, fowl, eggs, dairy and especially various plant sources (soy and other legumes, nuts and seeds) is essential for stress. Try to avoid processed proteins, such as packaged lunch meats and processed cheeses.</p>


<li>
</li>

<strong class="subtopic">SUGAR AND WHITE FLOUR</strong> 

<p>Ironically, foods made with these ingredients such as doughnuts, rolls, pies, cakes, cookies,crackers, and candy bars are the ones that many people suffering from chronic stress</p>

<p>crave. Sugar and white flour are entirely naked calories, the metabolism of which drains an already depleted body of the vitamins and minerals it needs to heal or to maintain.</p>

<h2>Music For Stress Relief</h2>

<p>Music can be a powerful tool for stress relief. Listening to calming and relaxing music can help to slow your heart rate, lower your blood pressure, and ease muscle tension.</p>
<p>Here are some types of music that are good for stress relief:</p>
<ul>
<li>
    <strong class="subtopic">Classical music</strong>
    <p>Classical music is often associated with relaxation and peacefulness. The slow tempo and calming melodies of classical music can help to soothe the mind and body.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <strong class="subtopic">Nature sounds</strong>
    <p>The sounds of nature, such as waves crashing on the shore or birds chirping in the trees, can have a calming and restorative effect on the mind and body.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <strong class="subtopic">Ambient music</strong>
    <p> Ambient music is designed to create a calming and relaxing atmosphere. It typically consists of slow, ethereal melodies and soundscapes.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <strong class="subtopic">Slow, relaxing instrumental music</strong>
    <p>Any type of instrumental music with a slow tempo and calming melody can be effective for stress relief. This includes genres such as jazz, folk, and new age.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        
        <strong class="subtopic">White noise</strong> 
        <p>White noise, such as the sound of a fan or a rainstorm, can help to block out distractions and create a more peaceful environment.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong class="subtopic">Binaural beats</strong> 
            <P>Binaural beats are created by playing two slightly different frequencies in each ear. They have been shown to have a calming and relaxing effect on the mind.</P>
            </li>
        </ul>
             <p>It is important to find music that you personally find relaxing and enjoyable. Experiment with different genres and styles until you find something that works for you.</p>

                <p>In addition to listening to music, you can also incorporate music into other stress-relieving activities, such as yoga, meditation, or taking a bath.</p>

Anyone can practice meditation. It's simple and inexpensive, and it doesn't require any special equipment.

                      <p>Meditation has been practiced for thousands of years, originally meant to help deepen understanding of the sacred and mystical forces of life. These days, meditation is commonly used for relaxation and stress reduction. Meditation is considered a type of mind-body complementary medicine.
                      
                      Meditation produces a deep state of relaxation and a tranquil mind. During meditation, you focus your attention and eliminate the stream of jumbled thoughts that may be crowding your mind and causing stress. This process results in enhanced physical and emotional well-being.</p>

                      <p>Meditation can give you a sense of calm, peace, and balance that benefits both your emotional well-being and your overall health. And these benefits don't end when your meditation session ends. Meditation can help carry you more calmly through your day and can even improve certain medical conditions.</p>

                      <p>When you meditate, you clear away the information overload that builds up every day and contributes to your stress. The emotional benefits of meditation include:</p>
                      
                     <P>- Gaining a new perspective on stressful situations</P>

While a growing body of scientific research supports the health benefits of meditation, some researchers believe it's not yet possible to draw conclusions about the possible benefits of meditation. With that in mind, some research suggests that meditation may help such conditions as:</P>
                      
                      <P>- Allergies</P>
                      <P>- Anxiety disorders</P>

                      <P> Be sure to talk to your health care provider about the pros and cons of using meditation if you have any of these conditions or other health problems. In some cases, meditation can worsen symptoms associated with certain mental health conditions. Meditation isn't a replacement for traditional medical treatment. But it may be a useful addition to your other treatment.<P></P>

                      <strong class="subtopic">Everyday Ways to Practice Meditation</strong>
                      
                      <p>Don't let the thought of meditating the "right" way add to your stress. Sure, you can attend special meditation 
                          centers or group classes led by trained instructors. But you also can practice meditation easily on your own. 
                          And you can make meditation as formal or informal as you like — whatever suits your lifestyle and situation. 
                          Some people build meditation into their daily routine. For example, they may start and end each day with an 
                          hour of meditation. But all you really need is a few minutes of quality time for meditation. 
                          Here are some ways you can practice meditation on your own, whenever you choose</p>
                          </li>
                          <li>
                      
                      <h3>Breathe Deeply:</h3>
                      <uL>
                       <li>This technique is good for beginners because breathing is a natural function. Focus all 
                          attention on your breathing. Concentrate on feeling and listening as you inhale and exhale through your 
                          nostrils. Breathe deeply and slowly. When your attention wanders, gently return your focus to your 
                          breathing</li>
                  </uL>
  
                      <h3>Scan Your Body: </h3>
                      <ul>
                     <li> When using this technique, focus attention on different parts of your body. Become aware 
                      of your body's various sensations, whether that's pain, tension, warmth or relaxation. Combine body 
                      scanning with breathing exercises and imagine breathing heat or relaxation into and out of different parts of 
                      your body</li>
                  </ul>
  
                       <h3>Repeat a Mantra: </h3>
                       <ul>
                      <li>You can create your own mantra, whether it's religious or secular. Examples of religious 
                          mantras include the Jesus Prayer in the Christian tradition, the holy name of God in Judaism, or the om 
                          mantra of Hinduism, Buddhism and other Eastern religions</li>
                  </ul>
  
                       <h3>Walk and Meditate: <h3>
                      <ul>
                       <li>Combining a walk with meditation is an efficient and healthy way to relax. You can use 
                          this technique anywhere you're walking — in a tranquil forest, on a city sidewalk or at the mall. When you 
                          use this method, slow down the pace of walking so that you can focus on each movement of your legs or 
                          feet. Don't focus on a particular destination. Concentrate on your legs and feet, repeating action words in 
                          your mind such as lifting, moving and placing as you lift each foot, move your leg forward and place your 
                          foot on the ground</li>
                  </ul>
  
                      <h3>Engage in Prayer: <h3>
                          <ul>
                      <li>Prayer is the best known and most widely practiced example of meditation. Spoken and 
                          written prayers are found in most faith traditions. You can pray using your own words or read prayers 
                          written by others. Check the self-help or 12-step-recovery section of your local bookstore for examples. Talk 
                          with your rabbi, priest, pastor or other spiritual leader about resources</li>
                  </ul>
  
                      <h3>Read and Reflect: <h3>
                          <ul>
                      <li>Many people report that they benefit from reading poems or sacred texts, and taking a
                          few moments to quietly reflect on their meaning. You also can listen to sacred music, spoken words or any 
                          music you find relaxing or inspiring. You may want to write your reflections in a journal or discuss them with 
                          a friend or spiritual leader</li>
                  </ul>
  
                      <h3>Focus Your Love and Gratitude:<h3>
                          <ul>
                      <li>In this type of meditation, you focus your attention on a sacred object or 
                          being, weaving feelings of love and gratitude into your thoughts. You can also close your eyes and use your 
                          imagination or gaze at representations of the object.</li>
                  </ul>
  
                      <strong class="subtopic">Building Your Meditation Skills</strong>
                         <p>Don't judge your meditation skills, which may only increase your stress. Meditation takes practice. Keep in mind, 
                          for instance, that it's common for your mind to wander during meditation, no matter how long you've been 
                          practicing meditation. If you're meditating to calm your mind and your attention wanders, slowly return to the 
                          object, sensation or movement you're focusing on. 
                          Experiment, and you'll likely find out what types of meditation work best for you and what you enjoy doing. 
                          Adapt meditation to your needs at the moment. Remember, there's no right way or wrong way to meditate. 
                          What matters is that meditation helps you with stress reduction and feeling better overall.</p>

  <p>Some diets, like ketogenic and paleo, are great in some instances but are not best for those experiencing chronic stress or stress overdrive. Here are some tips to eating for stress:</p>
  
  <ul>
      <li>
  <strong class="subtopic">GOLDEN RATIO</strong> 
  
  <p>In each meal and snack include: protein (more vegetarian than animal); complex carbohydrates (whole grains), starchy vegetables (like carrots, sweet potatoes and legumes), and good quality fats (fresh olive, coconut, sesame, or flax oil)</p>
  
  </li>
  <li>
  
      <strong class="subtopic">EAT YOUR VEGETABLES</strong> 
  
  <p>Every day, you should include 6-8 servings of a wide variety of vegetables in your meals, especially those that are naturally highly colored (bright green, red, orange, yellow or purple). Vegetables provide essential vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and a high amount of fiber.</p>
  <li>
  </li>
  
  
  <strong class="subtopic" >AT REGULAR INTERVALS</strong>
  
  <p>Long periods without food and nourishment make your adrenals work harder, which means more cortisol released to help the body function. Having 3 nutritious meals, plus 2-3 snacks spread throughout the day, is a great way to help balance blood sugar and decrease the workload on your adrenals.</p>
  <li>
  </li>
  
  <strong class="subtopic">CAFFEINE</strong> 
  
  <p>Like what you eat, what you choose to drink will either support or put a strain on your adrenals. People with chronic stress should avoid caffeinated drinks like coffee, tea, soda, and energy drinks. The caffeine may provide a temporary boost, but it will leave you feeling worse soon after.</p>
  
  <li>
  </li>
  
  <strong class="subtopic">DON'T FORGET THE PROTEIN</strong>
  
  <p>Good quality protein from meat, fish, fowl, eggs, dairy and especially various plant sources (soy and other legumes, nuts and seeds) is essential for stress. Try to avoid processed proteins, such as packaged lunch meats and processed cheeses.</p>
  
  
  <li>
  </li>
  
  <strong class="subtopic">SUGAR AND WHITE FLOUR</strong> 
  
  <p>Ironically, foods made with these ingredients such as doughnuts, rolls, pies, cakes, cookies,crackers, and candy bars are the ones that many people suffering from chronic stress</p>
  
  <p>crave. Sugar and white flour are entirely naked calories, the metabolism of which drains an already depleted body of the vitamins and minerals it needs to heal or to maintain.</p>
  </li>

  <h2>Music For Stress Relief</h2>
  
  <p>Music can be a powerful tool for stress relief. Listening to calming and relaxing music can help to slow your heart rate, lower your blood pressure, and ease muscle tension.</p>
  <p>Here are some types of music that are good for stress relief:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>
      <strong class="subtopic">Classical music</strong>
      <p>Classical music is often associated with relaxation and peacefulness. The slow tempo and calming melodies of classical music can help to soothe the mind and body.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
      <strong class="subtopic">Nature sounds</strong>
      <p>The sounds of nature, such as waves crashing on the shore or birds chirping in the trees, can have a calming and restorative effect on the mind and body.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
      <strong class="subtopic">Ambient music</strong>
      <p> Ambient music is designed to create a calming and relaxing atmosphere. It typically consists of slow, ethereal melodies and soundscapes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
      <strong class="subtopic">Slow, relaxing instrumental music</strong>
      <p>Any type of instrumental music with a slow tempo and calming melody can be effective for stress relief. This includes genres such as jazz, folk, and new age.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
          
          <strong class="subtopic">White noise</strong> 
          <p>White noise, such as the sound of a fan or a rainstorm, can help to block out distractions and create a more peaceful environment.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong class="subtopic">Binaural beats</strong> 
              <P>Binaural beats are created by playing two slightly different frequencies in each ear. They have been shown to have a calming and relaxing effect on the mind.</P>
              </li>
          </ul>
               <p>It is important to find music that you personally find relaxing and enjoyable. Experiment with different genres and styles until you find something that works for you.</p>
  
                  <p>In addition to listening to music, you can also incorporate music into other stress-relieving activities, such as yoga, meditation, or taking a bath.</p>

                    <p>Meditation has been practiced for thousands of years, originally meant to help deepen understanding of the sacred and mystical forces of life. These days, meditation is commonly used for relaxation and stress reduction. Meditation is considered a type of mind-body complementary medicine.
                    
                    Meditation produces a deep state of relaxation and a tranquil mind. During meditation, you focus your attention and eliminate the stream of jumbled thoughts that may be crowding your mind and causing stress. This process results in enhanced physical and emotional well-being.</p>

And these benefits don't end when your meditation session ends. Meditation can help carry you more calmly through your day and can even improve certain medical conditions.</p>

                        </li>
                        <li>
                    
                    <h3>Breathe Deeply:</h3>
                    <uL>
                     <li>This technique is good for beginners because breathing is a natural function. Focus all 
                        attention on your breathing. Concentrate on feeling and listening as you inhale and exhale through your 
                        nostrils. Breathe deeply and slowly. When your attention wanders, gently return your focus to your 
                        breathing</li>
                </uL>

                    <h3>Scan Your Body: </h3>
                    <ul>
                   <li> When using this technique, focus attention on different parts of your body. Become aware 
                    of your body's various sensations, whether that's pain, tension, warmth or relaxation. Combine body 
                    scanning with breathing exercises and imagine breathing heat or relaxation into and out of different parts of 
                    your body</li>
                </ul>

                     <h3>Repeat a Mantra: </h3>
                     <ul>
                    <li>You can create your own mantra, whether it's religious or secular. Examples of religious 
                        mantras include the Jesus Prayer in the Christian tradition, the holy name of God in Judaism, or the om 
                        mantra of Hinduism, Buddhism and other Eastern religions</li>
                </ul>

                     <h3>Walk and Meditate: <h3>
                    <ul>
                     <li>Combining a walk with meditation is an efficient and healthy way to relax. You can use 
                        this technique anywhere you're walking — in a tranquil forest, on a city sidewalk or at the mall. When you 
                        use this method, slow down the pace of walking so that you can focus on each movement of your legs or 
                        feet. Don't focus on a particular destination. Concentrate on your legs and feet, repeating action words in 
                        your mind such as lifting, moving and placing as you lift each foot, move your leg forward and place your 
                        foot on the ground</li>
                </ul>

                    <h3>Engage in Prayer: <h3>
                        <ul>
                    <li>Prayer is the best known and most widely practiced example of meditation. Spoken and 
                        written prayers are found in most faith traditions. You can pray using your own words or read prayers 
                        written by others. Check the self-help or 12-step-recovery section of your local bookstore for examples. Talk 
                        with your rabbi, priest, pastor or other spiritual leader about resources</li>
                </ul>

                    <h3>Read and Reflect: <h3>
                        <ul>
                    <li>Many people report that they benefit from reading poems or sacred texts, and taking a
                        few moments to quietly reflect on their meaning. You also can listen to sacred music, spoken words or any 
                        music you find relaxing or inspiring. You may want to write your reflections in a journal or discuss them with 
                        a friend or spiritual leader</li>
                </ul>

                    <h3>Focus Your Love and Gratitude:<h3>
                        <ul>
                    <li>In this type of meditation, you focus your attention on a sacred object or 
                        being, weaving feelings of love and gratitude into your thoughts. You can also close your eyes and use your 
                        imagination or gaze at representations of the object.</li>
                </ul>

                    <strong class="subtopic">Building Your Meditation Skills</strong>
                       <p>Don't judge your meditation skills, which may only increase your stress. Meditation takes practice. Keep in mind, 
                        for instance, that it's common for your mind to wander during meditation, no matter how long you've been 
                        practicing meditation. If you're meditating to calm your mind and your attention wanders, slowly return to the 
                        object, sensation or movement you're focusing on. 
                        Experiment, and you'll likely find out what types of meditation work best for you and what you enjoy doing. 
                        Adapt meditation to your needs at the moment. Remember, there's no right way or wrong way to meditate. 
                        What matters is that meditation helps you with stress reduction and feeling better overall.</p>

                <h2>EATING FOR STRESS</h2>

<p>Even in the best of times, you need food to survive and be healthy. Chronic stress (or stress overdrive) are certainly not the best of times, so the food choices you make become even more important to your health.</p>

<p>Some diets, like ketogenic and paleo, are great in some instances but are not best for those experiencing chronic stress or stress overdrive. Here are some tips to eating for stress:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
<strong class="subtopic">GOLDEN RATIO</strong> 

<p>In each meal and snack include: protein (more vegetarian than animal); complex carbohydrates (whole grains), starchy vegetables (like carrots, sweet potatoes and legumes), and good quality fats (fresh olive, coconut, sesame, or flax oil)</p>

</li>
<li>

    <strong class="subtopic">EAT YOUR VEGETABLES</strong> 

<p>Every day, you should include 6-8 servings of a wide variety of vegetables in your meals, especially those that are naturally highly colored (bright green, red, orange, yellow or purple). Vegetables provide essential vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and a high amount of fiber.</p>
<li>
</li>


<strong class="subtopic" >AT REGULAR INTERVALS</strong>

<p>Long periods without food and nourishment make your adrenals work harder, which means more cortisol released to help the body function. Having 3 nutritious meals, plus 2-3 snacks spread throughout the day, is a great way to help balance blood sugar and decrease the workload on your adrenals.</p>
<li>
</li>

<strong class="subtopic">CAFFEINE</strong> 

<p>Like what you eat, what you choose to drink will either support or put a strain on your adrenals. People with chronic stress should avoid caffeinated drinks like coffee, tea, soda, and energy drinks. The caffeine may provide a temporary boost, but it will leave you feeling worse soon after.</p>

<li>
</li>

<strong class="subtopic">DON'T FORGET THE PROTEIN</strong>

<p>Good quality protein from meat, fish, fowl, eggs, dairy and especially various plant sources (soy and other legumes, nuts and seeds) is essential for stress. Try to avoid processed proteins, such as packaged lunch meats and processed cheeses.</p>


<li>
</li>

<strong class="subtopic">SUGAR AND WHITE FLOUR</strong> 

<p>Ironically, foods made with these ingredients such as doughnuts, rolls, pies, cakes, cookies,crackers, and candy bars are the ones that many people suffering from chronic stress</p>

<p>crave. Sugar and white flour are entirely naked calories, the metabolism of which drains an already depleted body of the vitamins and minerals it needs to heal or to maintain.</p>
